Implementation of 3 different brute force algorithms:

#### Simplest brute force:  
Simple brute force algorithm, absolutely random.  

#### Dictionary brute force:
This brute force algorithm uses dictionary with most popular passwords/logins, checks every of them in every combination of upper or lowercase letters. 

#### Vulnerability brute force:
This one is based on server responses, some of them may guide us. It also measure time between responses to check if server is not hiding something.
